# Sound Sleep
<p><b>Sound Sleep</b> is a health and lifestyle management type android app for android 11 and above 
which allows the user to change the Ringer of their mobile phones to <b>Vibrate</b> or <b>Silent</b>
or <b>Do not disturb</b> at a scheduled time of their choice automatically. <b>Sound Sleep promises 
to be Free and Ad Free.</b></p>

<p>This means the user can choose a time when they want their mobile phone to be set to vibrate or 
silent mode daily and the time when they want to reset it back to normal mode. The app then will 
automatically change their ringer profile of their choice so they can do their work or have a 
<b>Sound Sleep</b> in peace and when they are done or wake up, their ringer profile would have already been 
set to normal mode.
